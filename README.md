# FlyLight-Split-GAL4-Curation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/VirtualFlyBrain/FlyLight-Split-GAL4-Curation.svg?branch=Script-Working)](https://travis-ci.org/VirtualFlyBrain/FlyLight-Split-GAL4-Curation)

A repository for code to create curation records for Janelia FlyLight Split-GAL4 images.

**Contents**

Python script for creating curation record tsv files for a given doi and ds name and datafiles from Janelia FlyLight API along with Gillian's FlyLight combination lines tsv file.

'src/problem_records/' contains records being held either because the kb isn't ready or information required for loading is missing.


**Git Workflow**

Current:

Run JRC2018_ds_tsv_for_curation.py, specifying doi and ds name (currently need to edit the script to do so). Script will pull required fields from JRC2018_Unisex_20X_split_fileNames1.csv and JRC2018_VNC_Unisex_split_fileNames1.csv to get image filenames and publishing names of split-GAL4 lines, then extract hemidriver names from flylight_combination_lines_2.tsv. YAML files must currently be created manually.

Planned:

Working on implementing a re-useable pipeline to reduce the requirement for co-ordination, workflow to be updated.

Curation files created with this code are loaded through the [curation repo](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/curation).
